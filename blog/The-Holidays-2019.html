<h1>The Holiday's 2019</h1>
<small>[<a href='The-Holidays-2019.html'>link</a>]</small>
<p>Dec 19, 2019.</p>

<p>Winter has set in.</p>

<p>I've started to blog, purpose of it is debatable but I hope to bring interesting content to it over the years. Here's a small introduction to where I am now in my life:</p>

<p>I am planning on becoming a student of psychology soon. The place I currently live in isn't ideal for attending school, it's a bit run down and far away from any of the universities so I plan on moving first.</p>

<p>I live with my boyfriend and two cats. I've been playing around on a Maschine Mk1, reading books and going between a few odd jobs.</p>

<p>I'm interested in computers as well! Before I thought about taking Psychology and working with the disabled I first wanted to take CS. Though, being honest it really isn't for me! I'm more interested in picking up projects at my own pace and learning about computers how I want to. Whatever interests me! I'd rather keep it a fun game than make it a job.</p>

<p>I hope to mix a interest of music, computers, internet culture and psychology would make me worth keeping a blog. Even if its just random rambles or stupid drawings some weeks.</p>

<p>This Holiday my boyfriend got me a rather cool rubber bong, some upgrades for the Maschine, and TINHIFI T2's because I had mentioned them before to him.</p>

<p>We plan on going to the French side of town and getting chocolates and having dinner after Christmas. I will have a few pictures up soon. Anyways the blog is up, see you soon. (thanks Luke, I make plunderphonics don't be too mad :P)</p>
