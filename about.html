<p><big>Review:</big></p>
<p><big>Pre-University:</big></p>
<p>I was a production assistant in the film industry in Toronto.</p>
<p>I made 2 short film's in the time, I wish I could find copies of those.</p>
<p>I than decided to travel as a hitch-hiker.</p>
<p>While I was a hitch-hiker I met my current boyfriend and we've started to make our lives in his home town.</p>
<p>I got access to funding for school, I tried some computer science but decided that wasn't the career for me.</p>
<p>I decided to take psychology, and start working with the handicaped as I had valued jobs before where I worked with someone who was disabled</p>
