Kevin's About</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><big>Review:</big></p>
<p><big>Pre-University:</big></p>
<p>I was a production assistant in the film industry in Toronto.</p>
<p>I made 2 short film's in the time, I wish I could find copies of those.</p>
<p>I than decided to travel as a hitch-hiker.</p>
<p>While I was a hitch-hiker I met my current boyfriend and we've started to make our lives in his home town.</p>
<p>I got access to funding for school, I tried some computer science but decided that wasn't the career for me.</p>
<p>I decided to take psychology, and start working with the handicaped as I had valued jobs before where I worked with someone who was disabled</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>and now for some nonsensical notes...</p>
<i>Metaphysically I'm a Pandiscordian Evolutionary Perennialist. I believe strongly in perception and perceptions deceptions (please correct all errors by calling #305)...
I'm a Bishop of the Pandiscordian Odorless Ordained World Organization Order (POOWOO). We have Churches located in places we haven't chosen yet...
Personality is the ability to annoy (or disappoint) people consistently. Only people with no personality make others happy...
I've discovered though my reading that the most evil number is actually not the number 666. Apparently many schoolyard children refer to 7 as the most evil number. One would want to ask why? Well, its simple really. Seven ate Nine.</i></p>
