<h1>Kevin's Gear and Software</h1>

<p>I'm using a pretty cheap setup. I am building my 'nest egg' which should help me into my 40's.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Laptop</dt>
<dd>My laptop is a <a target="_blank" href="">Thinkpad X201t</a>, it's running Windows 10. I don't use it for much at all other than school and learning. My phone is currently my main device for /random/. <b>I'm looking to upgrade and add more options to my collection</b></dd>
<dt>Phone</dt>
<dd>My phone is a <a target="_blank" href="">Samsung A8 (2018)</a>, It's running Android 9. I don't use it for
much more than media consumption, work, organization, and planning. It does the
trick and never lags for me. I use PowerAmp for music.</dd>
<dt>PMP</dt>
<dd>My Personal Media Player is a <a target="_blank" href="">IPod Touch 6</a>. <b>I'm looking to upgrade</b></dd>
<dt>IEM</dt>
<dd>My In Ear Monitor's are a pair of <a target="_blank" href="">TINHIFI T2's</a>, they are really nice neutral sounding IEM's. <b>I'm looking to upgrade and add more options to my collection</b></dd>
<dt>MIDI Controller</dt>
<dd>I have a <a target="_blank" href="">Maschine MK1</a>, it's my only media device. I bought it second-hand. Getting the software was a pain in the ass. <b>I'm looking to upgrade and add more options to my collection</b></dd>
</dl>
