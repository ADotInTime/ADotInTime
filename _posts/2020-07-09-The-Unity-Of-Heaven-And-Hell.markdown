Unity of Heaven and Hell
K.S.C

1. Heaven exists as does subjective reality, each religion to their own heavens.
2. Hell is an exclusively Christian idea of punishment, and is subjective as much as reality is.

The unity of heaven and hell, the subjective heaven argument.

Each religion reaches for their heaven. Heaven is defined as the final state of a soul. The passage into the astral reality. The astral, is made up of many angles. The angles is where each heaven for each religion resides.

To thelma we have little concept of the afterlife. Ideas from The Book of Law gives us the concept of selection, the do what thy will idea of choosing a heaven. The magic or subjective existence continues into heaven and beyond our dreams.

Our dream world is made up of the connection between the known and unknown, each person goes into the known in the afterlife. The known is the purity, our domain. We continue to exist in the known as though it were heaven. The known is where we find heaven in life.

The same is for the afterlife, we come into the known ideas that we accept.

Much of the ideas of the biblical come from the bible, but with the death of old gods all heavens have no ruler, making each heaven converge in the star of heavens center. Thus the living might notice the dead or the opposite. But each interacts in kind.

The unknown is hell, but it belongs with heaven, the unity is undenighable. You can not resist the unity of heaven and hell.

So we name the converging heavens hell, or hallsabah the warzone of beliefs.

1. Hallsabah is the center of the heaven star.
2. Hallsabah is the convergence of heavens.
3. Hallsabah is unknown and uncontrollable and might interfere with the heavens.


This work is the groundstone for the Death Worship side of the White Sun Society.
