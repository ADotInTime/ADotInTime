The Heaven Star
K.S.C

An endless pointed star that spirals downwards towards other heavens. Each point directs towards a personal heaven of someone or a religion. Each point is hell for the individual. The highest point, upward facing is the higher self.
The lowest point is the lower self. The individual rotates between these two heavens, passing through the center of the heaven star. The heaven stars center is the intersection of the heavens, or otherwise hell. 
One must maintain position in the higher to achieve a full heaven, a lesser heaven would be the lower point, where needs are not met. The person might find voices invading his concousness. Or the presence of other entities that distrube the nature of their heaven.

Maintaining the higher heaven brings one closer to the higher form, the higher form of the 13th.
