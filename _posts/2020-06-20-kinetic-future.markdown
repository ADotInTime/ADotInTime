Kinetic Dawn is the title of the current book I am writing. It's a book about rebirth in a quantum future, taking notes from the Many Worlds Theory, it takes place in a future that has already gone nuclear, however some binding force keeps everyone going on as normal. It's become normal to know about the nuclear failure. So man progresses in his plight to destroy himself. By creating the Rods Of God.

You see the book from the eyes of an artist called Marcus, who died by suicide in the 2020's. He is in an artifical whomb being reborn into the future. He plays out a simulation, a what if he did not die.

You also see the story from the eyes of Father, the man who purchased Marcus's soul. His desires to become a father, and his experiences in the post-nuclear world. US and THEM between the two half's of the world.

I hope to bring this work of fiction to you sometime in 2021. Please stay tuned to my blog for progress.
