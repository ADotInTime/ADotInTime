<h1>The Next Year</h1>
<small>[<a href='The-Next-Year_Dec_2019.html'>link</a>]</small>
<p>Dec 27, 2019.</p>

<p>Old becomes new, but it'll come with a curve.</p>

<p>This year I'm splitting my personal time into a couple main things. Music, Computers, Studying, and Reading.</p>

<p>With music, I want to master the Maschine 2 software, and the Maschine MK1 I own. I might not end up making an album this year, but at least one jam would be good.</p>

<p>With computers, I'd like to do some basic application development. I have a basic idea of a tape machine sequencer. I think I could make some VST's or DAW-like software that could be useful even if just personally.</p>

<p>With Studying, I want to read more into Psychology and Practice. Don't know what to say on this right now.</p>

<p>With reading, 6 books is good.</p>

<p>I'll also be looking to move to a new place with my boyfriend and get a new job with it. But that is life time, not personal time.</p>
