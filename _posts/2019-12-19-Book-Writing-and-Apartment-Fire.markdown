  I've been writing a sci-fi novel just out of personal pleasure. I recently lost my place due to a fire and ended up homeless. I lost my computer so I had to get a laptop to replace it. It's just a cheap Lenovo A1. It's actually not that bad. Compared to my previous laptop it at least holds a battery charge.

  I don't imagine programming much in the near future, a lot of my programming skills are very rusty thanks to the fire, school, and work. It's disapointing because I have a few really good idea's for hardware/software projects. I might get a raspberry Pi 0 just to play around with who knows...

  for now I intend to save as much as possible, I'm interested in getting into music so that might be my plan, music making rather than programming, being an artist.

  So its music, writing, and art for me. Moving away from computer science.

  I also met my real father in the time that I was away, it was awkward and not really great, but at least we met.
